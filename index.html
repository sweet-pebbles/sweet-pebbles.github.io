            <h1>Goodbye</h1>
            <p id='letter'>                
                Dear friend,<br/>
                Ever since I sent you that Pebbles letter, I knew that any letter could be my last and I feel like that time has now come.<br/><br/>
                I hope all this isn't too much. I had to make sure that you don't get into any trouble in case your parents found the ball.<br/><br/>

                I don't see you in the evening anymore. I don't know what could be the reason for that. Either you are busy or you are not coming because of me.
                But, I believe that the reason might be me. In that case, I owe you an apology. Please forgive me if any or all of my actions 
                caused you any trouble and made you feel uncomfortable. I just hope that there are no misunderstandings between us. 
                Before you went away for the whole of July, you said Hi to me after reading my last letter. Then, five days after that, 
                I know that you called me from your mother's number. It is possible that the call was from someone else but I like to believe that you called me.<br/><br/>

                When you came back, I wanted to say Hi to you. But, whenever I want to do it, my hands get paralyzed and I end up not doing anything. 
                It could be because my roof is in the open and your neighbors can easily see if I did something. Or, it could be that I am shy. 
                I am not shy but I still don't know why I can't say Hi to you. You already had my number so I thought you would simply call me the next time you see me. 
                I don't know why you never called me again but if calling me was too much, you could have messaged me instead.<br/><br/>

                Since it's now time for farewell, I want to make sure that we part ways without any misunderstandings.
                I don't know if you will ever be able to understand why I sent you my first letter but I can at least try for one final time.<br/> 
                I didn't send that letter because I am a boy and that's what boys do, chase after girls. That's not me. 
                If someone had asked me that in the future I will send letters in a ball to a girl, I would have laughed at their face. 
                I see lots of girls in the evening, but I never sent them anything. I have been seeing them since childhood but I saw you and your little brother 
                for the first time in May. For twenty one years, I didn't even knew that a person like you even existed. That's why I sent you the letter. 
                I wanted to know everything about you. I wanted to know your name. I wanted to know what you study and I wanted to know if you had seen me before. 
                I was hoping to find a great friend in you.<br/><br/>
                I don't live in this city anymore but this is the place where I was born. It will always have a special place in my heart and it seemed 
                very special to me that out of all the places in this world, I could make a very close friend just behind my house.<br/><br/>
            
                Before sending that first letter, I didn't knew anything about you. There is not much you can tell about someone from a distance but 
                when I saw you play with your brother, you seemed kind to me. That was enough for me. The rest was just a leap of faith.<br/>
                You were a complete mystery to me and it will most likely stay that way now.<br/>
                My father's job involves frequent transfers. Changing places and schools frequently meant that I never managed to make any close friends in my childhood. 
                We aren't children anymore but knowing you was the closest chance I would ever get to have a childhood friend.<br/><br/>

                I was not able to know you but you have already created a permanent impact on my life. This experience will impact my future decisions 
                as I am sure they will impact yours. Memories fade with time but I will always remember writing these letters as you would remember reading them. 
                All this that happened seems more like a story in a book than something that would happen in real life. Sadly, this story didn't have a happy ending.<br/><br/>

                I will always remember you as a friend. I don't know your name and will never get the chance to know it. But, we know the name of our friends 
                and I suppose it doesn't matter now what I call you.<br/>
                So, I will remember you by the name Sonya. It's the name of the girl in the book I am reading currently. 
                The book is a Russian novel called "War and Peace". The name is Russian too but like I said it doesn't matter now.<br/><br/>

                So, my dear Sonya, I want you to know that there are no hard feelings on my side. Friendship is a mutual relationship and 
                if you don't want to know me then I respect your decision.<br/>
                There were two writers in this story but the person who was going to write the ending was always you.<br/><br/>

                I apologize again for all this. My classes are online. That's why I was able to live here with Dadi. But, her food isn't getting any better and
                I have been away from home for two months now.
                I am still here for a few days but I promise you that I will never look again in your direction and there is no need to feel uncomfortable in my presence. 
                So, please don't stop coming to your roof because of me. I respect your privacy. This is my last letter to you. Nothing follows hereafter.<br/><br/>

                I wish that you lead a fun and exciting life. I am sure that you will become a great person one day.<br/><br/>

                This story doesn't have a happy ending but that doesn't mean that this letter cannot have one too. <br/>
                <b>So, I have something for you on the next page. A token of goodwill.</b><br/><br/>
                Clicking on the "Send" or "Continue" buttons below will take you to the next page.<br/><br/>
                I'll probably never see you again. I know that. And you know that. And knowing this, I say farewell.<br/><br/>
                <b>Goodbye Sonya</b>
