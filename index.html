                Hi<br/><br/>
                I hope all this isn't too much. I had to make sure that you don't get into any trouble in case your parents found the ball.<br/>
                It is possible that this might be my last letter to you which means this is my only chance to clear any misunderstandings between us or say my final goodbye.<br/>
                First, let me clear all misunderstandings. I will skip a lot of details because if it is indeed a goodbye, none of this would matter and I have to save space to say more important things.<br/>

                I sent my last letter on 22nd June. Four days later, you waved at me. I waved back but maybe you didn't see it. I thought you would call me that day but you didn't. That was the last time I saw you before you went away for more than a month. Five days later, you called me using your mother's number. I am assuming that the call was from you instead of a random person. Anyways, I missed your call. Two hours later, I called back. Your mother received the call. I asked if she called me and she said no. Then I hanged the phone saying something like "I am sorry. Must be wrong number".  Then, a month later, you were back.
                I didn't knew you were back until I saw someone on your roof lighting diyas. It was dark but I knew it was you. I was very happy that day. The next day, I saw you on the roof. That was the first time we were seeing each other in the evening after you came back home. We both made eye contact again and again but no one did anything. Then, after some time, I made a gesture at you by waving my phone to call me but I think it would have been better to say Hi first. Anyways, I don't think you saw that gesture because you didn't called me that day too. The next day, you came very late and went downstairs in about 5 minutes. <br/>

                You have now stopped coming to your roof. I am guessing it's because of tutions or something. It's been around 50 days since you have my number. I don't know why you are not calling me. I just hope that you don't think that I am ignoring you because I would never do such a thing. If it's because I didn't waved at you after you came back home, it's simply because whenever I want to say Hi to you, my hand gets freezed. I just feel a little bit shy wheneven I want to say Hi to you. Also, your neighbours keep looking towards me. I don't want them to know that I am waving at you. The distance between our houses also creates problems in communication. Both of us sometimes miss each other's gestures.<br/>

                I hope this cleares all misunderstandings between us. So, if you weren't messaging me because of these misunderstandings, I am hoping that I can now finally get to know you. It's been too long already. If you are still not ready or willing to share your number with me, then this time I am also writing usernames of a couple of my social media accounts. I don't use social media but I have created acoounts on them so that you can message me there.<br/><br/>

                Snapchat: aryan_earth<br/>
                Instagram: aryan_earth<br/>
                Mobile Number: 7015230859<br/><br/>
                And please don't take too much days this time and don't wait for me to say Hi to you on the roof before messaging or calling me because chances are I will mess it up again by not doing anything.
                We are not strangers anymore. But we aren't really friends either. We are in a very weird position. I understand that it's a big step for you to message me. It was also a big step for me to send that first letter. I didn't knew anything about you. All I hoped for was that you were a good person. Sometimes, you have to take a leap of faith first. The trusting part comes later. That's all I can say. I didn't did all this to convince you to message me. I just wanted to clear everything and then let you decide for yourselves. I was hoping to find a great friend in you. But, that's not my decision to make. It has always been yours.<br/>
